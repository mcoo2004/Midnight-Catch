Midnight Catch

Overview:
"Midnight Catch" is a solo-developed horror-adventure game that takes players on a chilling nocturnal fishing trip, blending serene moments with escalating horror elements. Set against a backdrop inspired by PS1-style graphics and atmospheric horror, the game follows a fisherman exploring a mysteriously off-limits lake at night, encountering increasingly disturbing catches and events.

Concept:
The game draws inspiration from classic and indie PS1-era horror games, renowned for their low-res polygonal graphics and engrossing atmospheres. "Midnight Catch" aims to recapture this unique blend of nostalgia and terror.

Gameplay:
Players navigate the dark waters in first-person perspective, using WASD for movement and mouse controls for casting and reeling in the fishing rod. The game unfolds as players catch various fish, each revealing parts of the eerie narrative. With two distinct endings, players face choices that lead to survival or demise.

Mechanics and Dynamics:
Boat Navigation: Control the boat using WASD and mouse for steering and looking around.

Fishing: Cast the rod with a mouse click, reel in catches, and experience the core gameplay mechanic driving the narrative.

Atmospheric Horror: A cautious playstyle is encouraged, with jump-scares and a tension-filled atmosphere.
